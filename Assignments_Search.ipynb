    "# EDAP01 - Assignment Search: Solving a Maze Using Different Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are supposed to code the following search algorithms to solve various given mazes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Breadth-first search (BFS)\n",
    "    - Depth-first search (DFS)\n",
    "    - Uniform-cost search (UCS)\n",
    "    - Greedy best-first search (GBFS)\n",
    "    - A* search\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the basic instructions below to complete this notebook. For each search algorithm, report the following findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The solution and its path cost\n",
    "    - The total number of nodes expanded\n",
    "    - The length of the frontier\n",
    "    - The total memory size to store all nodes\n",
    "    - The depth size \n",

Each search algorithm has its own Python file (e.g. bfs.py), which is instantiated from the base class **SearchAlgorithmBase**, as defined in base.py. Your algorithms are expected to use the properties and methods of **SearchAlgorithmBase**. You need to complete and submit these Python files in this folder.\n",
    "* `src/maze.py`: This file contains the maze class with all the required methods to generate a maze. **You should not make any changes to this file.**   \n",

It will run the search algoritm **example** defined in ./searchalgorithms/example.py on the fifth maze (i.e., maze_id=5). If everything works correctly, a new window will pop up showing the maze with the start and end points indicated in blue and red, respectively. Since this example code is incomplete, no path will be computed. Therefore, the code will output a message indicating that there are zero expanded nodes and cost. To close the new window, just press the **Esc** button. Note that the final version of the map with the found path will be automatically saved as an image in the ./images folder. You should then see the following image: ./images/maze_5_algorithm_example.png. "
